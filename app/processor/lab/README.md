## Bird Detector Lab

Experiment and utility area for bird detection model development and dataset handling.

- Keep small, focused tools that help with data preparation, conversion, and model iteration.
- Favor reproducible, scriptable workflows that can run inside the processor container.
- Use `.storage` for local scratch artifacts (archived streams, extracted frames, etc.) so outputs stay isolated from code.
